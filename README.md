# SNU-4D-Mode
SNU 4D (4 Dimensional mode) is an improvement over 3D mode, in which 4D graphics are used in 3D graphics (Example: Cubes become Tesserects) it takes a little bit of extra processing power for the browser to render it, compared to 3D mode.

# About

SNU 4D mode is a 4 dimensional mode of SNU that supercedes 3D mode (however, 3D and all other modes are still usable and still get updates) where the graphics get an overhaul, and are converted to 4D graphics. An example would be when cubes turn to tesserects. It requires a little extra processing power for the web browser to do this. Also, since the human eye can't see in 4 dimensions, this is going to look really odd to people.

It is a mode for people who are interested in 4D. If it is requested enough, a 5D mode may be added.
